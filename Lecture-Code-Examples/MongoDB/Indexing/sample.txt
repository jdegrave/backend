// Let's say you have a database with entries that look like this:
// lower selectivity

{ _id: ObjectId(), a:1, b: "ab"}

















// look for patterns that match:
// it first matches a, then b
{ a: 2, b:"no"}  // have to search at least 3 documents to find the no

{ a: {gt}}


// second set is high selectivity - which is what you want - to look at the fewest
// documents possible to find match or not find it
